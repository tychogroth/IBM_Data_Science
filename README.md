# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Projects

This repository contains some select projects I've completed as part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) on Coursera. The program is an intensive series of courses that cover a variety of data science topics, from data visualization to machine learning.

## Toronto Segmentation Project
As part of the course, I completed a project on segmenting and clustering Toronto. This project helped me understand the concepts and tools required for geographical segmentation and clustering.

## Stockholm Bakery Location Analysis
For my capstone project, I decided to take the knowledge I gained from the Toronto project and apply it to Stockholm. The goal was to find the optimal location for a bakery by clustering and segmenting the city.
